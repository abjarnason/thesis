\section{Objectives and Scope}

The objectives of this thesis are

\item To evaluate WebSocket, its benefits and challenges for a web based chat application
\item To evaluate container-based virtualization for WebSocket infrastructure through the design and implementations of a simple WebSocket-based messaging system
\end{itemize}

\section{Thesis Structure}

Chapter 2 begins with a historical background of data transfer on the web and the limitations of current approaches for real-time communication on the web. The WebSocket standard is then introduced as a possible refinement for event-driven communication on the web and a standard for the real-time web. Finally, alternative technology standards are presented that have to potential to challenge WebSocket for specific types of real-time communication on the web.
\\ \\
Chapter 3 provides a general introduction to microservices and pinpoints potential benefits and challenges. The chapter also covers asynchronous communication patterns and containerized virtualization which are concepts used in the implementation of a messaging system presented in the following chapter.
\\ \\
In Chapter 4 a messaging system is introduced that enables clients to communicate with a back end service with the WebSocket protocol. The tools used to build the system are introduced along with design and implementation decision. Afterwards, results of benchmarking tests are presented which are seen as the foundation for further development along with ideas for further improvement of the messaging system.
\\ \\
Chapter 5 discusses challenges related to the deployment of WebSocket applications and considerations for containerized infrastructure from the perspective of the WebSocket protocol. These considerations are based on empirical knowledge acquired during the development of the messaging system from Chapter 4 and related experiments.
\\ \\
Chapter 6 concludes the thesis and presents ideas for further work and discusses possible next steps related to the work carried out as a part of this thesis.
