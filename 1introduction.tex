\section{Objectives and Scope}

The objectives of this thesis are

\begin{itemize}
\item To evaluate WebSocket, its benefits and challenges for a web based chat application
\item To evaluate container-based virtualization for WebSocket infrastructure through the design and implementations of a simple WebSocket-based messaging system
\end{itemize}

\section{Thesis Structure}

The second chapter of the thesis starts with a historical background of data communication for the web and limitations of current approaches to real-time data transfer. The WebSocket standard is then introduced as a possible foundation for the real-time web. Finally, alternative technologies are presented that provide functionality similar to WebSocket and have the potential to challenge WebSocket as standards for certain web-based data communication.
\\ \\
Chapter three provides a general introduction to microservices along with potential benefits and challenges. The chapter then covers asynchronous communication patterns and containerized virtualization both of which are utilized in the implementation part of the thesis.
\\ \\
In the fourth chapter a messaging system is introduced that allows clients to communicate with a backend service using the WebSocket protocol. The tools used to build the system are introduced and design and implementation decision presented. Afterwards, results of benchmarking tests are revealed along with ideas for further improvement of the system.
\\ \\
The fifth chapter discusses challenges related to containerized WebSocket infrastructure and introduces strategies and best practices so that the benefits of WebSocket can be achieved. These ideas are based on experience obtained during the development and deployment of the messaging system.
\\ \\
The sixth and final chapter presents conclusions of the thesis along with suggestions for further work and the next steps related to this project.
